# High-speed parallel operator.
#
# This device template allows offloading code to a different interpreter
# process to circumvent the GIL and implements the infrastructure to
# achieve this with minimal code.
#
# It moves an object called 'operator' to a separate process and a Qt
# thread in the main process to send commands and receive data via pipes
# from the operator. After an optional prefiltering stage in the agent
# the data is sent via Qt signals to the main thread. It is possible to
# use a separate process for each operator as well as pool operators on
# the same process by targeting an existing process.
